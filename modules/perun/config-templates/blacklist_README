Blacklisting of IdPs in discovery service is consider as NOT SECURE.
Because of it it is not (and won't be) implemented.
Proper way is to remove (comment) IdP metadata.
In case of automatic metadata management with metarefresh module use its blacklisting features
Config file 'config-metarefresh.php' contains property 'blacklist'. Use it.
